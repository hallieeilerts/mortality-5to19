  #' @title Squeeze LRI
  # 
  #' @description Multiply predicted LRI fraction by crisis-free deaths. Subtract respiratory TB single-cause deaths to get residual LRI deaths. If residual LRI deaths are less than minimum LRI deaths, divide total LRI deaths by the sum of respiratory TB single-cause deaths and minimum LRI deaths. Use this factor to scale down respiratory TB single-cause deaths and minimum LRI deaths. Calculate fractions from scaled respiratory TB and minimum LRI deaths using crisis-free envelope. Sum fractions for TB and respiratory TB to get total TB fraction.
